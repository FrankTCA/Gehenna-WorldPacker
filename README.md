# PresetPacker
A project that can be used by OTG preset creators to package their preset as a separate mod, just like Biome Bundle, Skylands, Flatlands and Void.

How to use:
1. Download the source code
2. Open build.gradle and edit where it says "Edit Here"
3. Replace the "MyPreset" folder under "presets" with your own preset
4. (Optional) If you want to use your own logo, replace the "logo.png" file under "src/main/resources/"
5. Run the "build_preset.bat" file
6. Find your preset jar under "output"

Make sure the version of your preset matches the version you put in build.gradle

* Check that your mod is set up correctly by making sure it show up in the mods menu, and the mod logo is displayed in the OTG world creation menu.
